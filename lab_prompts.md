# Lab Session: Prompt Log
**Student Name:** _____________________
**Instructions:** Record the exact prompts you typed into GitHub Copilot for each step below (copy/paste). Optionally include key parts of Copilot’s response.

## Step 1: Role & Requirements Clarification (Reverse Prompting)
*(Paste your persona setup and your request for **clarifying questions** here. The goal is to have Copilot ask you ~3 questions about requirements/business rules/inputs/edge cases **before writing any code**. These are requirements-clarification questions for the coding exercise (not a job interview).)*


## Step 2: Planning (Zero-Shot CoT + RAG)
*(Paste your prompt asking for a step-by-step refactoring plan referencing coding_standards.md. Include “Let’s think step by step.” Do not generate code yet.)*


## Step 3: Execution (Few-Shot + Tool Use)
*(Paste your prompt containing the docstring examples and your request to implement the refactor. Then paste the prompt that asks Copilot (as a unit test generator) to create `unittest` tests targeting edge cases/boundary conditions.)*


## Step 4: Review (Reflexion + Self-Consistency)
*(Paste your prompt asking Copilot to critique its own code for logic gaps/type hints/tests, then produce a V2. Also include your prompt requesting 3 alternative implementations and a recommendation.)*
